Oligonucleotides can be ordered from IDT, resuspended, and used directly in CircLigase reaction to produce synthetic library.\nLibrary insert size is critical to success using the TIRF Transformer system and rolling circle surface amplification (RCA). Template copy number in sequencing clusters is highly dependent on insert length. Longer insert translates to lower copy number in RCA generated sequencing clusters, and consequently, reduced signal upon Lightning Terminator incorporation.\nRevision history Document Version number Date Description of change Library preparation: synthetic library v1.0 12/2023 Original document -KF Materials and equipment Item Vendor Catalog number/link Synthetic library molecule: /5Phos/AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG IDT Notes before starting Consider insert length when designing synthetic library molecules as longer inserts will compromise sequencing quality (lower signal per cluster). We have achieved good results with 16 nt inserts.\nCircLigase efficiency decreases with templates greater than 100 nt. We have achieved good results with templates from 85 to about 300 nt.\nExonuclease treated CircLigase products are cleaned up using Ampure XP beads. Alternative purification methods suitable for single stranded circular DNA can be substituted.\nProcedure 1. Prepare materials Resuspend or dilute synthetic templates to 100 µM in nuclease free H₂O Optional: prepare aliquots to minimize freeze-thaw cycles Optional: Pool synthetic templates to reduce number of circularization reactions Combine equal volumes of each 100 µM template (minimum of 4 µL required per reaction for next steps) 2. Circularization of synthetic templates Prepare one new, clean PCR tube per circularization reaction One reaction should produce ample material for hundreds of sequencing reactions Templates can be pooled or circularized individually Load the following program on a thermocycler: Temperature Time 60 ºC 16 hours 80 ºC 10 minutes Prepare CircLigase Reaction Mix by combining the following components in order on ice using the tubes prepared in step 2.1: Reagent Volume for 1 reaction Final concentration Nuclease free water 13 µL Circligase buffer, 10x 2 µL 1x MnCl₂, 50 mM 1 µL 2.5 mM ATP, 1 mM 1 µL 50 µM Synthetic template(s), 100 µM total 2 µL 10 µM total CircLigase I 1 µL 5 U/µL Total volume 20 µL Vortex and spin down reaction mix Load tubes onto thermocycler and run the program loaded in step 2.2 3. Exonuclease cleanup Optional: Prepare linear controls with and without exonuclease treatment: Transfer 18 µL of 1x CutSmart buffer or 1x CircLigase buffer into two tubes, one labeled -exo and one labeled +exo Add 2 µL of the 100 µM linear synthetic templates used in circularization reaction to each of the two tubes Prepare exonuclease mixture: Combine 1 µL Exonuclease I and 1 µL Exonuclease III in a tube per reaction on ice Note: exonuclease III is only needed for templates with secondary structure and/or contaminating double stranded DNA Vortex and spin down Add two µL of exonuclease mixture to each CircLigase reaction and +exo linear control tube on ice. Pipette up and down to rinse tip after dispensing mixture Vortex each reaction mix and spin down Load the following program on a thermocycler: Temperature Time 37 ºC 40 minutes 80 ºC 20 minutes 4 ºC forever 4. Library purification: 1.2x ampure cleanup Prepare materials: Allow Ampure XP beads to come to room temperature for 15-30 minutes Prepare a fresh 80% absolute ethanol solution by combining 200 µL molecular biology grade absolute ethanol with 50 µL of nuclease free water per sample Vortex Ampure XP beads aggressively to ensure beads are resuspended in a homogenous solution Label one clean, new PCR tube per sample for the final elution step Dispense 26 µL well mixed Ampure XP beads into each sample, pipetting up and down at least ten times to mix beads with sample Pipette slowly and carefully, bead mixture is viscous Incubate samples with beads on benchtop for 5 minutes After 5 minute incubation, place samples on magnet stand and allow beads to pellet for 5 minutes Using a p-100 or p-200 pipette, remove supernatant from each sample tube while on magnet stand, leaving behind beads pelleted to tube wall Ethanol wash: Dispense 100 µL 80% ethanol solution into each sample tube Rotate tube 180º in magnet stand Once beads have pelleted on the tube wall again, carefully remove supernatant Repeat ethanol wash (step 4.6) again for a total of two washes Dry beads: After removing supernatant from the second wash, spin tubes down and replace on magnet stand with caps open Using a p-10 pipette, remove any excess ethanol solution Leave caps open and allow beads to dry for 3-5 minutes Beads are sufficiently dry when pellet goes from a shiny to matte finish. Beads are overly dry if bead pellet begins to crack Elute DNA Once beads are dry and any ethanol has evaporated off, dispense 30 µL of nuclease free H₂O or low TE buffer onto bead pellets Vortex each sample to ensure beads are in solution and not stuck to sides of tube Quickly spin down to bring liquid to bottom of tube without pelleting beads Incubate samples on benchtop (not magent) for 2 minutes Replace samples on magnet and allow beads to pellet for 2 minutes Carefully transfer supernatant containing DNA into the new, clean tubes prepared in step 4.1.4. Beads can be discarded 5. Library quantitation and quality check Determine library concentration in ng/µL Libraries can be quantitated using fluorometric (Qubit ssDNA kit or other similar) or A260 (Nanodrop or similar) Using library concentration and known size of synthetic templates, determine molarity (nM) The +exo control tube should not have any DNA 6.

The UI , which coordinates data collection steps at a high level and allows use of the instrument as a manual microscope. Setup We will soon make a prebuilt Raspberry Pi image that can be flashed directly to a SD card and used immediately. Until then, or for development purposes, the steps below describe how to set one up from scratch.\nInstallation Base operating system image The HAL requires Raspbian Bullseye 64-bit. This can be installed using the Raspberry Pi Imager as described on the Raspberry Pi website. As of this writing, this OS is a little buried: after opening the “Operating System” menu, open “Raspberry Pi OS (other)” and scroll down to “Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 64-bit)”.\nWe recommend setting up the Pi with only basic peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor, and optionally wired network) connected — do not plug in any 454 hardware yet.\nCommon dependencies There are a number of packages that will need to be installed to be able to compile and run the UI and HAL. Turn on the Pi, connect it to a network, and in a terminal, run the following:\n# Initial setup sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade # Convenience packages sudo apt install htop tmux mosh git build-essential rsync python3-pip # Needed to build libcamera-apps sudo apt install -y libepoxy-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5 sudo apt install -y libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libswresample-dev sudo apt install -y cmake libboost-program-options-dev libdrm-dev libexif-dev sudo apt install -y libboost-dev sudo apt install -y libgnutls28-dev openssl libtiff5-dev sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5 sudo apt install -y meson sudo apt install -y libglib2.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev sudo apt install -y libpng-dev sudo pip3 install jinja2 sudo pip3 install pyyaml ply sudo pip3 install --upgrade meson # Pi-specific packages for hardware access # These *can* be installed on an aarch64 Debian Bullseye installation # to compile there instead, but they will have to be manually copied from the Pi repo sudo apt install libcamera-dev libcamera0 libpigpio1 libpigpio-dev raspberrypi-kernel # Python packages for UI sudo apt install python3-pyside2.* python3-pil python3-numpy python3-jsonschema 454 software Now, it’s time to install the 454 software. In a terminal, run the following:\n# Create required directories mkdir -p ~/454/output/manual sudo mkdir -p /454/hal # Clone, compile, and install the HAL git clone https://github.com/454bio/454-hal.git ~/454/hal-src cd ~/454/hal-src git submodule update --init --recursive meson setup builddir cd builddir meson compile rsync -avd ./ /454/hal/ # Clone the UI git clone https://github.com/454bio/454-ui.git ~/454/ui Configuration To configure your specific hardware, first start by copying over the default configuration files:\nsudo cp ~/454/hal-src/assets/config/*.{json,ini,yml} /454/ Then the next steps depend on the components in your setup.\nTemperature sensor TODO: I2C vs 1-wire, need to enable in Pi config\nCamera TODO:\nPi HQ vs VC, relevant installation steps for each Mention pylablib Filter wheel TODO: stepper vs servo\nFocus calibration Finalizing your setup Connect hardware, run manually HAL in systemd Desktop shortcut to UI Usage Manual image capture The manual controls allow realtime control of the sequencer hardware. To use the manual controls, open the UI and click the “Manual controls” button.\nThe top half configures visible light TIRF. After enabling any number of LEDs using the checkbox on the right, an exposure time in ms and intensity in ‰ (parts per 1000) can be set. These TIRF settings will be used for “Flash”, which flashes the LEDs without capturing an image; “Capture”, which captures one image, saves it in ~/454/output/manual, and displays it in the preview; and “Start live preview”, which continuously captures images and displays them in the preview. The HAL automatically exposes the sensor just long enough for the configured TIRF.\nIf the filter is anything other than “Any filter”, the filter wheel will be moved to the set position before an image is captured.\nThe focus buttons nudge the base focus — the focus for all other colors will be adjusted by the same amount.\nThe “Heater” section will only be present if a temperature sensor is configured. The “Set” and “Disable” buttons respectively set the specified temperature or disable the heater entirely.\nThe “UV” section allows manual cleaving with the “Cleave”, and the time and intensity behave exactly like the visible light controls.\nAutomated data collection To collect data for sequencing automatically, open one of the preset sequencing protocols from the “File –\u003e Open” dialog and then start it by pressing “Start protocol”. It will run until completion unless stopped with the “Stop protocol” button or a hardware error is detected.\nTODO: Describe the available protocols\nWriting your own data collection protocol TODO\n","categories":"","description":"Microscope control software for automated data collection","excerpt":"Microscope control software for automated data collection","ref":"/docs/build/instrument-sw/","tags":"","title":"Instrument software"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

These oligonucleotides serve as forward primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA) to generate sequencing clusters. The forward strand will contain P5’ sequences, which will anneal to the surface immobilized P5 oligos and allow rolling circle amplification to produce the reverse strand. Hyperbranched clusters are produced by forward and reverse RCA products annealing to the surface and extending.\nOnce hyperbranched clusters are generated by RCA, Thermolabile USER II is used to cleave the reverse strands from the surface. After denaturing and washing, the sequencing reservoir surface contains thousands of forward strand RCA clusters.\nSince the TIRF system is so sensitive to incorporation at the sequencing reservoir surface, TdT is used to terminate any 3’ ends. After a last set of denature and wash steps, the sequencing reservoir is ready to sequence.\nRevision history Document Version number Date Description of change Surface amplification v1.0 12/2023 Original document -KF Materials and equipment Item Vendor Catalog number/link TODO Notes before starting Optimal circular library hybridization concentration is critical to achieving a high density of sequencing clusters without compromising monoclonality. We have achieved good results hybridizing clusters at concentrations of 0.15-0.4 pM, but ideal concentrations should be determined empirically.\nSodium hydroxide dilutions should be made fresh for same day use.\nProcedure 1. Prepare reservoir for hybridization Dispense 100 µL nuclease free (NF) H₂O into a new reservoir, being careful not to contact glass surface at bottom of reservoir Aspirate and discard the liquid from the reservoir with P-100 or P-200 pipette by tilting the reservoir opening towards you and carefully placing the tip of the pipette at the lowest edge of the reservoir 2. Hybridize library Dilute library to loading concentration Library should be at 0.15 - 0.4 pM in 2x SSC + 0.1% Triton X 100 (SSCT) Ensure there is at least 100 µL of diluted library per reservoir Dispense 100 µL diluted library into reservoir Incubate reservoir at 65º C for 4 minutes, 40º C for 44 minutes, and then room temperature for 4 minutes After final 4 minute room temperature incubation, remove and discard 100 µL solution from reservoir Dispense 50 µL of 1x RCA Buffer into reservoir Safe stopping point Proceed to cluster generation within 1 day. Reservoir can be stored at room temperature. 3. Cluster generation Make Phi29XT Reaction Mix using the table below, adding each component: Reagent Volume for 1 reservoir Final concentration Nuclease free water 60 µL Phi29-XT Reaction Buffer, 5x 20 µL 1x dNTP Solution Mix, 10 mM 10 µL 1 mM Phi29XT Polymerase, 10x 10 µL 1x Total volume 100 µL Vortex and spin down reaction mix, keep on ice Remove 1x RCA buffer from sequencing reservoir by tilting reservoir towards you and aspirating at the lowest edge of the reservoir with a p-100 or p-200 pipette Dispense 50 µL of the Phi29XT Reaction Mix into the reservoir Ensure liquid is at bottom of reservoir Store remaining reaction mix at 4º C for a reaction refresh Incubate reservoir at 42º C for 30 minutes Refresh Phi29XT Reaction Mix: After 30 minutes, remove 20 µL of Phi29XT Reaction Mix from reservoir Dispense the 50 µL of Phi29XT Reaction Mix remaining from step 3.3.2 into the reservoir and gently swirl Ensure all liquid is at bottom of reservoir and incubate at 42º C for an additional 2 hours After 2 hour incubation, proceed directly to step 4 4. Cleave reverse strands Begin incubating the reservoir with Phi29XT Reaction Mix at 37º C Dispense 2 µL of Thermolabile USER II enzyme into the reaction mix, pipetteing up and down to ensure full volume is dispensed Tilt the reservoir towards you and use a P-100 or P-200 pipette set to 50 µL to gently and carefully mix the liquid without contacting the bottom surface of reservoir Incubate the reservoir at 37º C for 30 minutes 4.5.\tAfter 30 minutes, remove the reaction mix Denature reverse strands Dispense 100 µL of 100 mM NaOH into reservoir Incubate 3 minutes at room temperature Remove NaOH from reservoir Rinse reservoir: Dispense 200 µL NF H₂O into reservoir Pipette up and down 3 times to agitate the surface of the reservoir with the liquid Remove NF H₂O Repeat step 4.6.3 two times for a total of three rinses Dispense 100 µL of 2x SSC + 0.1% Triton X 100 into reservoir Safe stopping point Reservoir can be stored at room temperature. 5. Block surface Albumin blocking: Prepare albumin blocking solution using the table below: Reagent Volume for 1 reservoir Final concentration Nuclease free water 42.5 µL Terminal Transferase Buffer, 10x 5 µL 1x Recombinant Albumin, 20 mg/mL 2.5 µL 1.12 mg/mL Total volume 50 µL Vortex and spin down mixture Remove liquid from reservoir Dispense 50 µL of albumin bocking solution into reservoir Incubate 10 minutes at room temperature 3’ end blocking: Prepare terminal transferase (TdT) Reaction Mixture using table below: Reagent Volume for 1 reservoir Final concentration Nuclease free water 35 µL Terminal Transferase Buffer, 10x 5 µL 1x CoCl₂, 10x 5 µL 1x Dideoxynucleotide Solution, 2.5 mM (0.625 mM each ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddTTP) 4 µL 0.2 mM Terminal Transferase, 20,000 U/mL 1 µL 400 U/mL Total volume 50 µL Vortex and spin down mixture Remove albumin blocking solution from reservoir Dispense 50 µL TdT Reaction Mixture into reservoir Ensure all liquid is at bottom of reservoir Incubate at 37º C for 30 minutes Denature protein and rinse reservoir Remove reaction mix from reservoir Dispense 100 µL of 100 mM NaOH into reservoir Incubate 3 minutes at room temperature Remove NaOH from reservoir Rinse reservoir: Dispense 200 µL NF H₂O into reservoir Pipette up and down 3 times to agitate the surface of the reservoir with the liquid Remove NF H₂O Repeat step 5.3.4 two times for a total of three rinses Dispense 100 µL of 2x SSC + 0.1% Triton X 100 into reservoir Safe stopping point Reservoir can be stored at room temperature, or proceed to sequencing protocol.

We are releasing it to the world so that anyone can get started.\nHow it works\nOur patented Lightning Terminators (LTs) illuminate clusters of bases.\nUnlike others, our process does not require fluidics of any kind — 454 sequencing is done in One Pot with mostly off-the-shelf hardware.\nLTs are cleaved from bases with ultraviolet light, meaning that TIRF alone is sufficient to both monitor and maintain the reaction.\nApplications\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
